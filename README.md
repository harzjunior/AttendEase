## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the AttendEase application on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- Node.js (version 14.x or later)
- npm (version 6.x or later) or yarn
- MySQL (version 8.x or later)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/attendease.git
    cd attendease
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3. Set up your environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your MySQL database credentials:
    ```env
    DB_HOST=localhost
    DB_USER=root
    DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
    DB_DATABASE=attendease_db
    ```

### Database Setup

1. Push the schema to the database:
    ```sh
    npx drizzle-kit push
    ```

2. Optionally, you can start Drizzle Studio for a visual interface:
    ```sh
    npx drizzle-kit studio
    ```

## Usage

### Development Server

To start the development server, run:
```sh
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Building for Production

To create an optimized production build, run:
```sh
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

To start the production server, run:
```sh
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

## Configuration

### Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is configured in `tailwind.config.js`. Here you can customize the theme, add plugins, and configure other Tailwind-specific settings.

### Drizzle ORM

Drizzle ORM is configured in `drizzle.config.js`. This includes the schema definitions and MySQL connection settings. Ensure your database credentials are correctly set in the `.env` file.

### Middleware

Authentication middleware is set up in `src/middleware.js`. It uses `@kinde-oss/kinde-auth-nextjs` for session management and redirects unauthenticated users to the login page.

### Utility Functions

Utility functions for the application are located in `src/utils/index.js` and `src/lib/utils.js`.

## Scripts

The following scripts are available:

- `dev`: Runs the Next.js development server.
- `build`: Creates an optimized production build.
- `start`: Starts the production server.
- `lint`: Runs ESLint for code quality checks.
- `db:push`: Pushes the schema to the database using Drizzle Kit.
